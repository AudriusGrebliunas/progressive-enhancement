                Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that
                gaz
                opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
                such thing as an issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
                Nothing exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
                reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for
                example. If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality
                changes
                depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.

            </p>

                They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself
                out of
                that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
                the
                person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can
                make
                your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                came
                around
                to
                commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
                    most
                    unfortunate</q>. The
                farmer
                said, <q class="farmer">Is it <em class="good">good</em>? Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't
                    know</q>.
                The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
                with
                it,
                and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great
                    turn of events. You now
                    have
                    eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Is it <em class="good">good</em>? Is it
                    <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know.</q>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em></q> and the
            farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Is it <em class="good">good</em>? Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I
                don't
                know</q>.
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
            son
            because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that
                great!</q> Again, he said,
            <q class="farmer"> “Is it <em class="good">good</em>? Is it <em class="bad">bad</em>? I don't know</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you
            never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.
        </p>

        <blockquote>Conclusion
            <em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em
                class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's
            not
            make a big deal out of it...
